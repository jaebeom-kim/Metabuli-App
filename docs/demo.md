## Acknowledgments
The development of the Metabuli Desktop Application has been inspired by and leverages the following tools:

- **Pavian**: Elements of the table layouts and visualizations in Metabuli were inspired by Pavian for metagenomic data analysis. ([Pavian GitHub Repository](https://github.com/fbreitwieser/pavian)).
  
- **Krona**: The Krona tool is embedded in the results page for hierarchical data visualization. ([Krona Github Repository](https://github.com/marbl/Krona/wiki)).

We would like to acknowledge the authors of Pavian and Krona for their excellent work, which has significantly contributed to the development of Metabuli.
